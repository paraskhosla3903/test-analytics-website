# Test Analytics Website

This is a prototype for an online Test Analytics Website, originally made for submission in HackMoL 3.0. 
We are trying to build a website that is can be used to conduct examinations and quizzes at various levels. This will be a complete profile based system which will resemble social media in some ways.
Your profile will have complete details of yours and may be linked with some of the payment methods, which will save you the hassle of long and lengthy registration processes for each test. 
It will have deep analysis system which will give you each and every small detail of your performance, for example graphs, time consumed per question, accuracy rate etc. 
It will contain all your tests and results at one place and also keep you updated with all the details of any upcoming ones.
You will be able to connect to all the organizations in which you are interested and will be notified of any updates. This will save you the trouble of subscribing to each organization individually for updates.
You will be able follow the areas of your interests and will automatically be notified if any exams are being held related to that field.
